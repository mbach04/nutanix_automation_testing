# HA Load Balancer for OpenShift

This playbook will create two HA load balancers, one for the masters and one for the default routers running on the infranodes 

As such this playbook should be run using and expanding an openshift-ansible inventory file.

This playbook should be run before OpenShift is deployed, so that the load balancers are available at deploy time.

Most of the information is deducted from the OpenShift inventory file.

Currently this playbook assumes that both the internal master FQDN and the external master FQDN resolve to the same VIP.  

The VIPs will be retrived by resolving the following FQDNs:

- master VIP: `{{ openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname }}`
- infranode VIP: `a.{{ openshift_master_default_subdomain }}`

If the DNS entries for the VIPs are not yet created, the VIPs can be specified as follow (replace with valid values for your environment):
```
master_vip: '192.168.1.1'
infranode_vip: '192.168.1.2'
```

This playbook expects two host groups:
```
[masters-lbs]

[routers-lbs]
```
Currently the playbook supports creating two separate load balancers, therefore these two groups must not have hosts in common. 

Currently this playbook supports only one VIP per load balancer. This means only one member of the load balancer cluster is active. In some situations it might be preferable to spread the load across multiple members. For this configuration to wrk the DNS must be able to load balance on multiple VIPs and the load balancer cluster mus expose multiple VIPs. This configuration is not currently supported.

## Ansible dependency check

This playbook requires `dnspython` to be installed on the ansible host. To verify this module is installed use the following command:
``` 
$ ansible localhost -m debug -a var='lookup("dig","google.com")'
``` 
If the above returns  
```
 [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available

localhost | FAILED! => {
    "failed": true,                                                                                                                                                 
    "msg": "Can't LOOKUP(dig): module dns.resolver is not installed"                                                                                                
}   
```
Then you need to install the `dnspython` module with pip. As root, perform the following.

```
yum install epel-release  
yum install python-pip 
pip install dnspython
```
